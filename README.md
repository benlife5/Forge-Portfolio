# Forge Launch Combined App

A Single Page Web App containing weather and restaurant apps for Forge Launch 2021. Users can enter coordinates, a ZIP code, their current location, or an address to search for weather and nearby locations. This app uses React, Material-UI, Ant Design, and Google, Mapbox, and Weather APIs.

## Limitations

This app was the combination of two separate apps originally so it does not have a unified style. Also, this app was developed before we learned backend development so API calls are client-side.
